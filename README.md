## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This is a monorepo managed with Turborepo:

### Apps and Packages

- `packages/react-iran-maps`: The main NPM package - interactive Iran map components
- `apps/docs`: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) documentation and demo site
- `apps/web`: Additional [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) web application
- `packages/eslint-config`: Shared `eslint` configurations

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm/yarn

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Start development mode (watches for changes)
pnpm dev
```

### Building Specific Packages

```bash
# Build only the react-iran-maps package
pnpm --filter react-iran-maps build

# Build the docs site
pnpm --filter docs build
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Run docs site in development mode
pnpm --filter docs dev

# Run the main package in watch mode
pnpm --filter react-iran-maps dev

# Type checking
pnpm check-types

# Linting
pnpm lint
```

### Package Scripts

The `react-iran-maps` package includes:

- `pnpm build` - Build the package for production
- `pnpm dev` - Watch mode for development
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm check-types` - Type checking with TypeScript

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```bash
cd my-turborepo

# With global turbo installed (recommended)
turbo login

# Without global turbo, use your package manager
npx turbo login
yarn exec turbo login
pnpm exec turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```bash
# With global turbo installed (recommended)
turbo link

# Without global turbo, use your package manager
npx turbo link
yarn exec turbo link
pnpm exec turbo link
```
